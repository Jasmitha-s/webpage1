            <h2>Nature: Keeping Wilderness Wild</h2>
            <img src="nature.jpg" alt="Nature" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or 
			the universe as a whole. In this general sense, nature refers to the laws, elements, and phenomena of 
			the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a 
			whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.</p>

            <h2>Technology: Connecting People</h2>
            <img src="tech.jpg" alt="Technology" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving practical goals, especially in 
			a reproducible way. The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including
			both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays
			a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.</p>

            <h2>Culture: Bridging Cultures, Uniting the World</h2>
            <img src="culture.jpg" alt="Culture" width="300" height="200">
            <p>A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress,
			language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.
			Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the 
			face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.</p>
